ideas for v1.1:

- a more complex randomization algorithms
- leaderboard!!!
- difficulty levels: easy/medium/hard
- ability to buy futures and shorts
- introduce a story, with events & choices that affect the gameplay 
  - "the government introduced crypto tax"
  - "someone hacked your crypto wallet"
  - "you got a job offer from a major investment fund"
  - and so on
- stagnation period: for 30 seconds, the price hovers in low 100-200s
- "to the moon": with a 0.5% chance, the coin jumps to the moon
- SecretCoin: a second cryptocurrency that needs to be unlocked
- NiceCoin: another cryptocurrency that unlocks when you hit $69420 exactly
- imaginary crypto startups that you can invest in
- NFTs, of course
- add shorting on margin, borrowing against other users that currently hold $RAND, and being force liquidated if the other users sell (via @vmception -- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30114358)
