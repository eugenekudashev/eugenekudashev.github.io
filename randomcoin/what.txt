cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, so you can either quickly get rich -- or, if you're not so lucky, quickly lose half your savings

to make fun of this very absurd part of modern life, i came up with a fictional cryptocurrency -- Randomcoin -- which price randomly changes each second

in this game, you're playing a crypto investor. buy low, sell high, watch imaginary numbers go up, and feel the dopamine rush wash all over your being

you perfectly know it's fake. but it still feels wonderful
