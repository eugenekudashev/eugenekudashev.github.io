		<h2>Hello and welcome to my website. This is a work in progress.</h2>

		<p>Some works are below, while others aren‚Äôt.</p>

		<p>I'm mostly interested in the weird and bizarre and absurd and silly, as well as dark, dystopian, frightening, and Oxford commas.</p>

		<details><summary>more?</summary><p>Eugene Kudashev (b. 1989, Leningrad, Russia) makes web art, writes serious essays and silly one-liners, and tries to make sense of the ever-present absurdity of today. His work explores how capitalism and Big Tech are destroying the social fabric, how human condition is experienced in 2022, how to create ethical public spaces for online hangouts, and how to fight totalitarian fascist state with memes ‚Äî and, above all, how to have fun online.</p></details>

	      <summary>follow my work // what, a newsletter???</summary>
	      <p>If you (for some reason) want to be notified when I release new things (as though you don't have enough notifications already), you can subscribe to my newsletter. The only problem is that I don't have a newsletter ‚Äî but I might start one once at least 50 people agree to receive it. <a href="https://eugenekudashev.typeform.com/to/qF2d5A">Leave your email address here</a> and maybe you'll get an email one day.</p> 
	    
	    <p>Why email? Why yet another newsletter? Well, apparently that's the only way to break out of the algorithmic censorship: all social networks present stuff in a feed, and there's no way to know what exactly is being hidden from you, and who exactly sees what, which is quite annoying to say the least. So email it is for now, I guess, until we get to a better internet.</p>

					<p>Mid-April 2019 a law was passed that made it legal for the Russian government to isolate the Russian segment internet from the rest of the world. Together with Nik we made a website counting the days until the law is effective (Nov 1, 2019). I also wrote a piece of dystopian flash fiction, portraying life from one year ahead in the future (in Russian).</p>

	  <div><h2>Person B</h2>
	    <p><em>897 words</em></p>
	    <p>"Person B is making a very good progress in their exploitation of fears and vulnerabilities of Person A, finding them intuitively, saying just the right things, and gradually pushing Person A into opening up more and more, and admitting other faults, not necessarily related to the events prior, and strengthening the guilt even further, and making them feel more and more insecure."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Someplace For Drinks But Never Dinner</h2>
	    <p><em>1,227 words</em>
	    "They started this game that involved saying ‚Äôi love you‚Äô in a dozen different ways while having sex, and even though both knew perfectly well that they‚Äôre both lying, it worked, as the emotional response was perfectly real, no matter how fake the trigger was, and the sex was significantly better, and once it was over they both went back to their regular selves, which didn‚Äôt involve anything romantic whatsoever, much less feelings."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Presence / Sunrise</h2>
	    <p><em>471 words</em>
	    "I keep thinking about the first sunrise on Earth. How magnificent and exquisite it must have been, and how symbolic, and how there was no one to look at it and thoroughly understand it, to remember it."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Turtles</h2>
	    <p><em>442 words</em>
	    "cross the lake. bob. smells of turtles. cook soup? hardly. no fire. she was exquisite, i fully agree. but can snakes be a little more gentle? can a snake cook soup for you? never tried snake soup. they say it‚Äôs healthy. Northerners. strange things constantly happen to me at the airport."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Hello Maria</h2>
	    <p><em>464 words</em></p>
	    <p>"I started smoking not because I like the smell of tobacco or the incredible feeling of exhaling smoke out of my mouth or whatever else other fantasies and associations people might have about smoking, but simply because it‚Äôs one of the very few things which give me a feeling of accomplishment, as silly as it sounds, like there is a clear beginning and end, you know, I know that for six or seven minutes I‚Äôll be sitting at a single spot, I‚Äôll roll the cigarette with my fingertips, I‚Äôll fire it up, and I‚Äôll just be inhaling and exhaling without doing much else, and it‚Äôs somehow reassuring and I would feel like I‚Äôve done something which is certainly complete nonsense, yet that‚Äôs how it is ‚Äì smoking sort of adds a bit of structure to my otherwise completely chaotic and messy life."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>The Other Planet As It Was Seen By An Alien Circa 2018 A.D.</h2>
	    <p>"I‚Äôve travelled to The Other Planet all the way from the planet Disappointment, which is really a misnomer, because my fellow people are generally content with their lives. I‚Äôve heard dozens of urban legends that try explain the name, one featuring a not-very-well-fact-checked dictionary, another a man who never got a decent haircut in his lifetime ‚Äì but these are all probably speculations. No matter. I like my planet. Other planets are fine, too ‚Äì I‚Äôve been to nine already ‚Äì and I wish I could visit all of them before I run out of fuel, either figuratively or literally. The citizens of Disappointment, or disappointianos for short (demonyms always puzzled me with their arbitrariness and unnecessary complexity, not to mention impracticality ‚Äì never in my life I felt the need to call anyone "disappointiano"), wanted to know everything about The Other Planet, and so it was my duty to go there, learn as much as I could, and come back full of news. The inhabitants of Disappointment are known for their mouth-watering curiosity."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>The unlikely event of landing on water</h2>
	    <p>"Cora came to Thailand to reunite with her long-distance boyfriend. They‚Äôve been together for seven months, of which six and half were spent four thousand miles apart. Merely two days later they got into a fight. You clearly don‚Äôt love me and you don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm here or not and you should‚Äôve told me so earlier, much much earlier. Some very ugly words were said. When she woke up at her hotel the next day, Facebook greeted her with a notification: Oliver updated his relationship status. There‚Äôs now a new profile picture, too: he‚Äôs standing in front of the ocean, smiling; next to him, a young Thai girl, looking suspiciously like a hooker."</p></div>
	    
	    <div><h2>Two hot black chicks jump on one lucky guy</h2>
	    <p>"James‚Äô plans did not involve any jumping this day; none whatsoever. He‚Äôs not much of a jumper. Never was. He‚Äôs more of a tuna-sandwich-with-mustard-at-three-in-the-morning person ‚Äì and it‚Äôs an established fact that people who eat tuna sandwiches at three in the morning are not renowned for their jumping excellence. Although they undoubtedly might‚Äôve been."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Fragile frames</h2>
	    <p>"He was a person of little talent, but one thing he was doing very well was always appearing front and center in every photograph, always with a confident, reassuring, nonchalant smile, always looking directly at the camera, producing an impression that this rectangular frame, once published, indeed genuinely depicts the truth as it is, that he indeed looks like that, that he‚Äôs smiling all the time, and that none of that is carefully and pedantically orchestrated. Most, if not all, of his efforts constantly went into building up some sort of image that corresponded to his naive, if not primitive, ideas of success, whatever they were, so he didn‚Äôt have much left for other activities, such as actually spend some hours living. What a bizarre idea."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>Escape</h2>
	    <p><em>An hommage to Julio Cortazar</em></p>
	    <p>"She loved to explore The City with me. We would walk around the streets together, for hours. Day or night, we would notice people in peculiar clothes, we would take pictures of odd chairs and books thrown away on the street, we would enter quiet courtyards and silently look what‚Äôs in them. I don‚Äôt think there was any reason to do any of that. No rational reason at least; no explanation as such."</p></div>

	  <div><h2>the horror and agony of saturday breakfasts</h2>
	    <p>generally i like cooking and eating but sometimes it‚Äôs all too much</p>
	    <details><summary>full text</summary>
	    <p>  each saturday i wake up and i‚Äôm deeply terrified because it‚Äôs yet another morning, which means i‚Äôll have to cook yet another breakfast ‚Äì for my gluttonous self, and for my significant other who could not care less about cooking but who i love dearly very much nonetheless. sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night, nervous and anxious about the upcoming breakfast. sometimes the anxiety kicks in even as early as the night before. i‚Äôm an adult, apparently. not exactly sure how did that happen. not that i feel like one, but whenever you find yourself in such a situation in life that there‚Äôs no one to cook breakfast for you and that you have to do it all by yourself -- that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre an adult. sure, you can go someplace to eat, but that also involves choices and decisions, plus sharing space with other people, who most likely will be loud and be there, is not necessarily how i want to start my Saturday. the easiest option, of course, is simply not to have any breakfast at all. that way you successfully avoid making a decision about what to eat. the tradeoff is that you‚Äôll be hungry soon, but that‚Äôs manageable. making a breakfast is terrifying because it starts with making a decision about what to make. you want it to be good. you want to cook the best breakfast imaginable, adhering to the unreasonably, ridiculously high standards that you set for yourself -- without any rational reason, too -- while all you have is two eggs. you‚Äôre going through your memory, mentally listing all breakfasts you ever had, and you‚Äôre fed up (not literally) with all of them, and you want something different, but you can‚Äôt figure out what exactly, and that‚Äôs disturbing. after 20 minutes you go on the internet, looking for ideas, for new recipes, for something to avoid cooking the same scrambled-eggs-avocado-salmon-and-baguette breakfast that you‚Äôve been eating each saturday for the past year and which you already loathe by now but opted for anyway, as it always was a safe choice. (what a first-world-white-people problem this is, really -- it‚Äôs almost pathetic.) minimal effort. which of course doesn‚Äôt necessarily lead to the best outcomes, but it keeps you in your comfort zone, so to speak. the agony intensifies. after half an hour of staring at all the pretty pictures of breakfasts from across the planet -- Turkish, Mexican, Moroccan, French, Irish, Thai, etc -- and discarding all the recipes either because they require an oven which i don‚Äôt have (because choosing one from dozens and dozens of oven out there proved to be impossible) or because they‚Äôre too complicated (meaning take more than 25 minutes from start to finish). food is weird. i don‚Äôt like talking about food. i don‚Äôt remember how i was eating five years ago, but i know for a fact that i didn‚Äôt think about it; at least not as obsessively and not that long. it was just food, i guess. now there is this impulse that came from god knows where -- living in Berlin for three years, maybe, the food capital of Europe, according to nobody in particular -- but food became kind of important, and you want to make it nice -- instead of just having a bunch of things that you shovel up your mouth, paying little to no attention to what it feels and tastes like, and moving on with your day. that‚Äôs probably the worst thing about grown-up life -- that you have to make decisions about what you‚Äôre going to eat, three times a day. doesn‚Äôt matter if you care deeply about food or not really, you have to make these choices, and they are tiring and overwhelming and by no means not easy (unless you‚Äôre okay with alternating between McDonalds and McDonalds twice a day). regardless of your tastes, you have to eat something. which involves buying groceries (making tons of uneasy choices in the supermarket, too), washing, cutting, etc, etc, or at least opening Uber Eats and trying to figure out what the fuck it is you want to eat today, if anything. next Saturday i‚Äôll just cook sunny sude up on toast and spend one hour saved by not overthinking on reading a book.</p>

	  <div><h2>The Perplexing Authenticity Of Fictional Characters</h2></div>
	  
	  <div><h2>Bojack Horseman s05e06 "Free Churro"</h2>
	    <p>Can you make a decent TV episode with 22 minutes of monologue?</p>
	    <details><summary>full text</summary>
	    <p>  BoJack‚Äôs mother dies, and he delivers a eulogy, which often veers off into bad standup, and then goes back to depressing and heavy childhood memories. There are no cinematic techniques employed, other than three different angles from which we see BoJack ‚Äì all the flashbacks are narrated, not shown ‚Äì so the episode kind of replicates life. We never see the audience (and their response) until the last minute.</p>
	    <p>  But what I‚Äôve been thinking about is that 22-minute interrupted monologues in fiction are rare, and it‚Äôs even more unusual on TV where plenty of visual variety is expected, so I‚Äôd go as far as to say that this a bold experiment. It‚Äôs definitely an unusual experience for the viewers, but it must be even more difficult for the writer. The whole episode is based on the words that the character (with the assistance of a voice over actor) is saying. And you, the writer, are delivering that monologue. Even though you don‚Äôt stand there personally and don‚Äôt say it yourself in front of a camera, you write the monologue, and it‚Äôs damn close. And there‚Äôs so much of your own personality going in there, unavoidably, which is a silly side thought that I‚Äôm going to leave for now.</p>
	    <p>  My main point is that it‚Äôs just very uncomfortable for most of us to go on and talk uninterruptedly for 22 minutes. And writing such a monologue for a fictional character is no easier. The traditional TV episode narrative structure with a clear setup, plot development and some kind of resolution, all shown in a sequence of 30‚Äì60-second scenes, mostly dialogue, combined with characters doing things and changing locations, is just so much easier to write. So I have immense admiration and respect for Raphael Bob-Waksberg and his writers for coming up with such a brilliant material.</p>
