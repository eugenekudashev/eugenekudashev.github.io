**i want to make software that is useful**, to many people; that is valuable, that makes sense. but that's also surprising, pleasant, funny.

**i want to make software that is serious and makes sense** but is also silly and doesn't.

**i want to make software that is not elitist** and which primary goal is not Shareholder Value. i want to make software for everyone; software that addresses some very basic personal human needs, that is not for a tiny exclusive group. software that speaks a universal language.

**i want to make software that would somehow immensely improve human lives**, one way or another. â€” that would help people understand one another better. â€” that would make it easier to learn and think. â€” that would help everyone live a full, interesting life.

**i want to make software that works in your interests**. that cares about its outcome, about the way it influences you as a person. that is very self-aware of the level of responsibility here, of all the potential risks. so it takes the time. it's working for you.

**i want to make software that helps realize the human potential** â€” and that also unlocks all the technology's potential. there's so many, and so much of it is still not used at all. there's no novelty in software; it's all boring and stuck and there were no new ideas for a decade.

**i want to make software that looks and feels like helpful reliable objects of daily lives do.** like a toothbrush, like a knife, like a chair. predictable, familiar, trustworthy. something that you own and have full control over, and can do anything you want with.

i want to make software for hanging out, for learning stuff, for finding people to hang out with, for building communities, for discovering the world better, for growing as a person, for being creative, for self-expression, for having fun, for being silly, for being themselves

**i want to make software that people would want to use.**

i want to make software that's beautiful, but not in the Pinterest sense.

i want to make software that has just 1 button.

**then i want to make software that has 0 buttons.**

i want to make software together with you.

**i want to make software that would set you free**
