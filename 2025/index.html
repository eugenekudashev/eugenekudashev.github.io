<h1>Hello! I’m Eugene.</h1>
<h2
id="i-make-landing-pages-that-answer-the-questions-that-your-visitors-are-actually-asking.">I
make landing pages that answer the questions that your visitors are
actually asking.</h2>
<p><strong>Very very soon I’ll start giving you my own little sweet
sales pitch (hire me!!!), but first ——</strong></p>
</section>
<h1 id="has-this-ever-happened-to-you">Has this ever happened to
you?</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>You open a landing page</strong> ↓</li>
<li>You skim, you read, you scroll, you skim ↓</li>
<li>You really want to understand what this is all about ↓</li>
<li>You want simple down-to-earth answers ↓</li>
<li>Instead, <strong>you’re bombarded with vague marketing
speak</strong>, lots of buzzwords and little facts ↓</li>
<li>Frustrated, <strong>you close the page</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This begs the question:</p>
<p><strong>Why are landing pages so hard?</strong></p>
<h1 id="a-good-landing-page-is-hard-to-write.">1. A good landing page is
hard to write.</h1>
<p>But it has nothing to do with writing!</p>
<p>You need to know very well what you want to say, and guess what
——</p>
<p><strong>It’s actually hard to know what to say.</strong></p>
<h1
id="to-know-what-to-say-you-need-to-do-a-great-deal-of-thinking-first.">2.
To know what to say, you need to do a great deal of thinking first.</h1>
<p>You need to answer some essential questions, let’s call this
“positioning”, such as:</p>
<p><b></p>
<ul>
<li>who is this product for?</li>
<li>what problem does this product solve?</li>
<li>how?</li>
<li>how is this problem being solved currently?</li>
<li>how is your product different from competitors?</li>
<li>who is this product <em>not</em> for?</li>
</ul>
<p></b> (And many others, you get the idea.)</p>
<h1
id="you-need-to-talk-more-about-the-person-reading-the-page-how-its-going-to-solve-their-problems">3.
You need to talk more about the person reading the page &amp; how it’s
going to solve their problems</h1>
<p>… than about yourself, the product, the features, etc.</p>
<p>This thinking is hard and takes time, yes. You need to understand who
these people are and what is it that speaks to them.</p>
<p>But without good clear answers to your readers’ questions, it’s
difficult to get them to care about what you’re selling.</p>
<p><strong>The point of your landing page is to convince the person to
try, and eventually buy, your product.</strong></p>
<p>It better do its job well, with strong arguments, not just empty
aspirational claims!</p>
<p>As always, there’s more to say, but I suppose we’re all short on
time.</p>
<section id="okay-so-here-comes-the-pitch"
style="color: black; background: orange; padding: .5em 1em;">
<h1>Okay, so here comes the pitch!</h1>
<h2 id="i-can-help-you-create-a-landing-page.">I can help you create a
landing page.</h2>
<p>(That’s it, that’s the pitch.)</p>
<p>A landing page that</p>
<ul>
<li>explains the product</li>
<li>in a language that its audience understands</li>
<li>shows understanding of the problem</li>
<li>answers reader’s questions upfront</li>
<li>doesn’t feel too salesy and is not afraid to make a joke</li>
<li>might or might not be the greatest landing page ever made (that’s
too subjective!)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h1 id="okay-you-might-have-many-questions-right-now-i-suppose.">Okay,
you [might] have many questions right now, I suppose.</h1>
<h1
id="let-me-try-to-address-them-in-the-spirit-of-practice-what-you-preach">Let
me try to address them, in the spirit of “practice what you
preach”!</h1>
<h3
id="your-specific-expertisebackground-that-qualifies-you-for-this-work">Your
specific expertise/background that qualifies you for this work</h3>
<p>15 years of marketing writing in tech, B2B SaaS but not only.
Namedropping: Contentful, Pitch, Prismic, Nuclino, Integrity; others,
too. Former founder of a mental health B2C startup; independent maker of
fun internet things. Deep hands-on understanding of tech. Extremely
online!</p>
<h3 id="what-specific-services-you-offer-and-at-what-price-points">What
specific services you offer and at what price points</h3>
<p><strong>1. Landing page critique:</strong> I look at your landing
page and tell you about its strengths and whatever is the opposite of
strengths, and suggest possible/impossible improvements</p>
<p><strong>2. Positioning workshop:</strong> I ask you a lot of
questions, and then some more questions, until we’re all happy with the
answers and the landing page practically writes itself</p>
<p><strong>3. Make my story bigger (aka Cool Story Bro):</strong> I come
up with a concept/narrative/story to make the landing page emotionally
compelling and to really tie all the elements together</p>
<h3
id="why-bring-someone-from-the-outside-why-not-just-do-it-in-house">Why
bring someone from the outside? Why not just do it in-house?</h3>
<p>An outside perspective is crucial because founders and teams are
often too close to their product. You know your solution inside out -
that’s your strength. But this deep knowledge can make it hard to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify which parts need more explanation</li>
<li>Spot confusing jargon or assumptions</li>
<li>Address key concerns new users might have</li>
</ul>
<p>As an outsider, I serve as your target user’s advocate, asking the
questions they’d ask and ensuring your landing page speaks their
language, not just yours.</p>
<h3
id="but-you-must-understand-the-market-and-the-audience-and-the-product-really-well-to-be-able-to-create-a-landing-page-for-it">But
you must understand the market and the audience and the product really
well to be able to create a landing page for it!</h3>
<p>Exactly, that’s why i talk to you to find out! I don’t try to come up
with the facts on my own, instead i’m asking you a lot of questions so
that you will tell me the answers; ultimately it’s you who’s writing the
landing page, not me. I’m just a really good interviewer who’s asking
the right questions, lots of them.</p>
<h3 id="cant-i-just-do-it-all-with-ai">Can’t I just do it all with
AI?</h3>
<p>AI can help with writing, but it can’t do the critical thinking and
strategic positioning work. AI won’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge your assumptions about your market</li>
<li>Identify blind spots in your product understanding</li>
<li>Ask the uncomfortable but necessary questions about
differentiation</li>
<li>Guide you through discovering your unique value proposition</li>
</ul>
<p>AI is a tool for writing copy once you know what to say. I help you
figure out what to say in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="past-work-examples-client-testimonials-or-results">Past work
examples, client testimonials, or results</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah we’ll get to that</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-kinds-of-startupscompanies-you-work-best-with">What kinds
of startups/companies you work best with</h3>
<p>early-stage, small teams, quick iterations, high ambition, innovative
products, high degree of critical thinking, high quality bar.</p>
<p>developer tools, creative tools, collaboration tools. productivity,
mental health, knowledge, learning.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-the-process-typically-takes">How long the process
typically takes</h3>
<p>That depends on your availability, because this is largely a
collaborative process. Critique can be turned in within a day or two.
Positioning workshop takes around a week; same for a Cool Story.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-start-working-with-you">How to start working with
you</h3>
<p>Just send me an email about your project and we’ll set up an intro
call for a proper talk: eugene.kudashev@gmail.com</p>
