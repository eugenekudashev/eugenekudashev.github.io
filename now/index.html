  <h1>what i'm working on right now</h1>

  <p><i>october 14, 2022 · 17:48 · berlin-neukölln, germany</i></p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>making berlin my home.</b> that's a tough one that involves navigating immigration bureacracy, tax advisors, insurance brokers, housing crisis, and so on. fun! my residence permit expires in 61 days, and i thought of turning this wonderful anxiety-inducing experience into a game. maybe someday.</li>
    <li><b>making an alternative to google maps</b> that encourages exploring your city with a less consumeristic approach: <a href="https://eugenekudashev.com/untitled-map-app/">untitled map app</a> (making this with Gabriel and Denis)</li>
    <li><b>setting up my <a href="https://eugenekudashev.com/blog/">blog</a></b> where i would write about personal computing, the future of social apps, and anything else (no rules!)</li>
    <li><b>developing a new framework for sharing thoughts and ideas on the internet, "raw content" or "non-content"</b>. it revolves around (1) recording very DIY, tiktok-style vertical videos and speaking in natural, honest way, (2) using speech recognition to add subtitles to the videos, (3) using speech recognition to create text transcripts and post them as articles, (4) using a bit of markdown magic to convert them to carousel-style infographics. basically make every story available in every media format & treat "content" as something that mirrors reality rather than creates a parallel, "polished" and very aesthetic-centered reality. <a href="https://twitter.com/eugenekudashev/status/1573341104543604737">see some preliminary results</a></li>
    <li><b>looking for freelance / consulting work.</b> i can do a million things, and i'll be glad to do creative/conceptual/storytelling work to help the right people make progress with their projects. i invented a moniker -- <a href="theideas.company">the ideas company</a> -- for this practice. but surprisingly monikers don't instantly bring clients!</li>
    <li><b>making art.</b> that's an everyday thing :)</li>
    <li>reading history and philosophy to understand how did the world get to where it is, what happened before and where do we go from here</li>
  </ul>
