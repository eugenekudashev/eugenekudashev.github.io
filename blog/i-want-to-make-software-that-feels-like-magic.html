<p><strong>i want to make software that is useful</strong>, to many people; that is valuable, that makes sense. but thatâ€™s also surprising, pleasant, funny.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that is serious and makes sense</strong> but is also silly and doesnâ€™t.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that is not elitist</strong> and which primary goal is not Shareholder Value. i want to make software for everyone; software that addresses some very basic personal human needs, that is not for a tiny exclusive group. software that speaks a universal language.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that would somehow immensely improve human lives</strong>, one way or another. â€” that would help people understand one another better. â€” that would make it easier to learn and think. â€” that would help everyone live a full, interesting life.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that works in your interests</strong>. that cares about its outcome, about the way it influences you as a person. that is very self-aware of the level of responsibility here, of all the potential risks. so it takes the time. itâ€™s working for you.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that helps realize the human potential</strong> â€” and that also unlocks all the technologyâ€™s potential. thereâ€™s so many, and so much of it is still not used at all. thereâ€™s no novelty in software; itâ€™s all boring and stuck and there were no new ideas for a decade.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that looks and feels like helpful reliable objects of daily lives do.</strong> like a toothbrush, like a knife, like a chair. predictable, familiar, trustworthy. something that you own and have full control over, and can do anything you want with.</p>

<p>i want to make software for hanging out, for learning stuff, for finding people to hang out with, for building communities, for discovering the world better, for growing as a person, for being creative, for self-expression, for having fun, for being silly, for being themselves</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that people would want to use.</strong></p>

<p>i want to make software thatâ€™s beautiful, but not in the Pinterest sense.</p>

<p>i want to make software that has just 1 button.</p>

<p><strong>then i want to make software that has 0 buttons.</strong></p>

<p>i want to make software together with you.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that would set you free</strong></p>
