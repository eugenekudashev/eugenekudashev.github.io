<p>————</p>

<h1 id="google-maps-effectively-stole-your-ability-to-explore-a-city">Google Maps effectively stole your ability to explore a city.</h1>

<p><strong>When you move to a new place, you don’t really discover it anymore — the way you will discover it earlier, in pre-GPS era.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s what happens. You move to a new apartment and you need to go to the office (at least in pre-covid times.) So you would select the place on Google Maps and it would draw you a route – or maybe two, or three routes sometimes – and you just follow them because it’s the easiest thing. You just moved, you don’t know anything, it’s easier to follow Google Maps.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/blog/untitled map app/3-routes.png" alt="" height="800" /></p>

<p>What happens then is that you stick to those routes for weeks, months, possibly years — it’s just much easier this way.</p>

<p><strong>And then the same patterns and habits begin to blur into every aspect of your life.</strong></p>

<p>What’s interesting is to think how Google routes are calculated. I believe they are optimized for efficiency: get there, fast. So what happens is you begin to also think in these terms — efficiency! — and instead of trying to see every street on your way, try different routes every time — you follow the same ones. The same ones, the same ones. And you don’t really think about it, too, because it turned into a habit very quickly.</p>

<h1 id="its-just-so-natural-to-follow-a-route-when-its-been-laid-out-for-you">It’s just so natural to follow a route. When it’s been laid out for you.</h1>

<p>This is something to be kind of a little sad about, I guess, because the sense of exploring the city is just magical. Wonderful, really.</p>

<p>Because the moment you do a detour from your typical route, the moment you find yourself on a new street, which is maybe like five minutes walk from your place is — you’ve been living here for several years, and now you find something new and unexpected in the city where you live.</p>

<p>I think that Google Maps and the whole GPS thing is partly responsible for that new passive behaviour. You see the entire city on a map, but you don’t really get the incentive to get anywhere, to explore.</p>

<h1 id="its-all-already-explored-why-bother">It’s all already explored. Why bother?</h1>

<p>It’s easier to go to another city to get a sense of exploration and novelty. It’s easier to do that than to find an unexplored place in a city where you already live. Which is extremely strange and counter-intuitive — because, for example, if you live in a large European city, there’s surely plenty of space to explore on foot. I feel that this approach to cities as something to explore is vastly overlooked and ignored.</p>

<p>Instead, the middle-class version of a city is reduced to a obligatory consumption rituals.</p>

<h1 id="this-sense-of-discovery-is-largely-forgotten-and-it-needs-to-be-revived">This sense of discovery is largely forgotten and it needs to be revived.</h1>

<p>You need to try to find your own routes. And technology can help.</p>

<p>One interpretation of technology made you follow the optimal routes, which are optimized for speed, not for quality of walk, not for you to see new things, to discover something. It’s not intended for you to enjoy the commute. It tries to make the commute as efficient as possible while disregarding the why: why does commute happen in the first place?</p>

<h1 id="its-not-always-about-optimizing-everything">It’s not always about optimizing everything.</h1>

<p>Yes, sometimes you need to get to place quick, but the other time you maybe want to see something new, find something new.</p>

<h1 id="theres-a-different-interpretation-of-technology-that-operates-in-a-different-genre-than-simple-pure-optimization-for-efficiency">There’s a different interpretation of technology that operates in a different genre than simple pure optimization for efficiency.</h1>

<p><strong>What if a map app would be able to suggest you a walk through places you have never been through?</strong> If it would try to maximize your enjoyment? (If one could quantify enjoyment, of course.)</p>

<p><strong>There could be very different way in which technology could be used to make your walks better.</strong> Instead of cold optimization, make them fun. Make them educational if you like. Turn the whole thing — walking around the city and exploring — into a game. Not an obsessive one, like Foursquare, but something more meaningful, educational.</p>

<p>Because there’s so much knowledge and history and culture in every city, which is deeply connected to its streets, to its houses, to its monuments — and lots of that knowledge is largely overlooked. The context is lost. There is very little ways that you can learn about your immediate surroundings. All the interesting stuff is in the books or in museums — or, at best, wikipedia. The contexts are disconnected.</p>

<p>I can easily stand next to a building where some famous politician or writer lived and not know about that while I stand there.</p>

<p><strong>You can use very simple technological inventions to seriously help you have better walks.</strong></p>

<p>————</p>

<h1 id="thats-why-together-with-gabriel-and-denis-im-making-untitled-map-app">That’s why, together with Gabriel and Denis, I’m making <em>untitled map app</em>.</h1>

<p>It is an app designed to help you explore the city.</p>

<p><strong>The idea is that initially the map is hidden and as you walk around you begin to unlock, uncover the map.</strong> And so over time you can see: what are the unexplored parts? What are the most interesting parts? You can create your own map — a map with the places that are important to you.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">IDEA: a mobile app that shows a city map, but everything on the map is hidden <br /><br />as you walk around the city (irl), bits and pieces are revealed on the digital map <br /><br />it&#39;s an interactive installation on your phone that turns long walks into a game, and the city into a playground <a href="https://t.co/VMUb0CDS6a">pic.twitter.com/VMUb0CDS6a</a></p>&mdash; eugene is trying his best to make you laugh 🥲🥲🥲 (@eugenekudashev) <a href="https://twitter.com/eugenekudashev/status/1553348984630116352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It becomes your diary; the recorded history of your interactions with the city.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/blog/untitled map app/berlin-sample.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s an attempt to move away from this very consumerism-centered view of a city — a map which is focused around restaurants and cafes and clubs and bars and shops. This map is focused around everything else.</p>

<h1 id="lets-remove-all-the-places-where-you-are-supposed-to-spend-money-from-the-map-and-see-whats-left-what-else-is-out-there">Let’s remove all the places where you are supposed to spend money from the map and see what’s left. What else is out there?</h1>

<p>You can discover a rare bench next to the point, you discover an embankment, which is mostly empty, with wonderful views and which is completely unknown and obscure. You can discover those hidden gems around the city.</p>

<p>So that’s the idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a map covered with the fog, to encourage exploration</li>
  <li>the map unlocks as you start walking around</li>
  <li>you can bookmark specific locations: a strange building, an unusual street, a nice viewpoint</li>
  <li>you can highlight interesting paths which are nice to walk through</li>
  <li>you can write text on the map</li>
  <li>you can draw on the map</li>
  <li>voice notes? right on the map? sure let’s throw that in as well</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../img/blog/untitled map app/maps with drawings.jpg" alt="" height="800" /></p>

<h1 id="can-i-exchange-bookmarks-maps-routes-with-friends">Can I exchange bookmarks, maps, routes with friends?</h1>

<p>Oh sure. Eventually! This will be very much a social app indeed.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of cool ideas that we have for that social part, but I probably won’t reveal everything all at once.</p>

<p>Let’s just say we’re thinking about this app in game terms, and we’re thinking about <em>single player</em> and <em>multiplayer</em>. If you’re into solo exploration, the app will greatly help you, and our initial focus goes there. However! If you’re not into that, but you’d love to get your friends’ maps and follow their paths, you could totally do that as well.</p>

<p>All the social aspects you can think of — what you can do when you add a digital layer on top of a physical space — I mean, the possibilities are really endless. There’s room for games. There’s room for interacting with strangers.</p>

<p><strong>And most of all, the app is meant to get you to shut down your phone and live irl.</strong></p>

<p>I hope you will have fun.</p>

<h1 id="lets-talk-about-a-good-day-on-the-internet-lets-imagine-a-day-that-i-go-online-and-i-spend-time-really-really-well">Let’s talk about a good day on the internet. Let’s imagine a day that I go online and I spend time really, really well.</h1>

<p>I wake up and I get a text from my friend, or better yet, <strong>I wake up and make coffee and my friend calls me and we just talk for like 10, 15 minutes.</strong> Maybe even without video, we just talk. And either we share some updates from our lives if haven’t spoken for a long time, or maybe just kicking jokes, you know, whatever. So that would be a good thing to happen on the internet.</p>

<p>I open my inbox and I would see a newsletter from a writer I really admire. So <strong>I read it and it fills me with something — with curiosity, or inspiration, or knowledge that I missed.</strong> Maybe it pointed me to an article that I would read and feel smarter or whatever. Something that would encourage me to think, to research, to maybe write something down. So that would be a good thing to happen on the internet.</p>

<p>A good thing to happen on the internet would be me developing some thoughts that I have into an article and posting it on my blog — and maybe an hour later, or a day later, or a month later, <strong>receiving a thoughtful, meaningful response from someone who I don’t know</strong>, who’s a perfect stranger, but has also been thinking about that. That would be a very good thing to happen on the internet.</p>

<p>Another good thing to happen on the internet is <strong>when you feel sad and you can go to a place where you can safely (and possibly anonymously) express your feelings</strong> and get a response and get a response almost immediately. Because you really need it. You really need it right now.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want an immediate response. Like if you’re in a room full of people and you just say, <em>Hey, I, I have a thing to say</em>, and you just say it. And maybe it was 10 people in a room. And they reply with something — maybe with a smile, maybe with a joke, maybe with some more serious response. But you get feedback, <strong>you get reaction from people, you get emotional response. That’s a good thing to happen on the internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Learning something new, discovering something new, getting a little closer to your understanding how the world works. That’s another thing. Also great to happen on the internet.</strong></p>

<h1 id="its-a-magical-place-it-could-be-a-magical-place">It’s a magical place. It could be a magical place.</h1>

<p>I don’t want to see any ads. I don’t want stuff being sold to me. I want to discover the internet on my own terms, and I want to connect with people who I know and I want to meet new people who could be my friends, my future colleagues, people who share my values, my opinions, my beliefs.</p>

<p>So those are probably some of the good things that are good to happen on the internet.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's talk about a good day on the internet.

<h2 id="i-met-some-incredible-people-on-twitter-by-accident-what-can-i-do-to-have-more-of-those-accidents">i met some incredible people on twitter by accident. what can i do to have more of those accidents?</h2>

<p>three days ago, i saw a tweet on my timeline (from someone i didn’t follow) that read (i’m paraphrasing) “i want to go back to blogging like it’s 2007” (self-hosted blog, just sharing thoughts and work and ideas, less performative) – a very relatable sentiment. this is something i’ve been thinking about in the past weeks (good job, algorithm), so i left a reply, asking for advice in terms of suitable tools to make it happen. a couple of people replied, and one reached out in DMs. we spoke a bit and it seemed like we had a lot of similar ideas, so we agreed to do a phone call. the next morning, we spoke for an hour, exchanging thoughts and ideas. this felt good.</p>

<p>this could be the beginning of an incredibly classy homosexual erotica. for better or for worse, it isn’t.</p>

<hr />

<p>the reason i’m bringing up this story is that the whole experience felt very reminiscent of the early 2000s internet, when you would just accidentally strike up a conversation with a stranger, and it would be a good thing. somehow, in the past years i can barely remember anything like that happening.</p>

<p>it’s hard to say whether it’s me (rarely replying to strangers’ tweets), or the environments (the algorithms kind of forcing everyone into their bubbles), or both, one influencing the other, both ways (you ask a genuine question and get a mean response, which makes you hesitant to approach strangers, etc.) – but either way, i clearly remember that i used to meet people online, and now i don’t.</p>

<p>it’s incredibly difficult to answer “why”, and also, it doesn’t really matter. what matters is: how do i change that?</p>

<h1 id="what-can-i-do-to-meet-people-who-share-my-interests-values-ideas">what can i do to meet people who share my interests, values, ideas?</h1>

<p>i am tempted to call this “networking that doesn’t feel like networking”. a conversation, a dialogue, which is equally interesting to both parties – unlike two sales pitches, two people mutually disengaged, talking “past each other”. a conversation that is fueled by substance, by <em>what’s being said</em>, not by pursuit of personal gain.</p>

<hr />

<p>the essential requirement for two strangers to start talking is some shared context.</p>

<hr />

<p>LinkedIn is where people speak about their work like they are on a job interview. on Twitter, people speak about their work because they care about their work.</p>

<hr />

<p>this morning i started thinking about some kind of “Discover” feature on top on twitter which would be helpful to me. how could it possibly work?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>one very obvious direction is to explore my social graph. i’m fairly certain that of some people who i follow, or who follow me, there are people with whom i might have something in common – but we’re unaware of one another’s existence. i assumer that the chances of <em>like-mindedness</em> are much higher within my micro-bubble than within a completely random sample of 1000 people on twitter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but bubbles are dangerous precisely because they are bubbles: they are not really inclusive by definition. they greatly limit your discovery opportunities by excluding everyone who is not already in some way connected to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>so another direction would be some extremely elegant way to find potential friends based on identifying similarities between you and other people. how can that be done?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>for example, you read an article and liked it so much that you tweeted a link to it. somebody else did the exact same thing. just this one piece of information can suggest that you might have something in common. perhaps that article can become this “shared context” over which you can strike up a conversation?</li>
      <li>of course, this is largely an oversimplification. after all, my tweet might read “oh my god i love this so much”, whereas a stranger’s tweet might read “oh my god i fucking hate this” – so the matchmaking algorithm would need to take this “emotional context” into account as well.</li>
      <li>now, let’s take this a bit further. let’s take not one tweet, but, say, one full month of tweets. this gives us much more information about a person, so we can start building their “profile”. (BIG ETHICAL DANGERS HERE! – <em>editor’s note</em>) we can start identifying recurring themes, their areas of interest, their sense of humour, and we can do better educated guesses on the potential “<strong>contexts of interest</strong>”.</li>
      <li>and so, now let’s imagine everyone has their “profile”, and they can choose to hit a button that, rougly, would read “i want to see someone new [who is, in some way, kinda like me]”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>AN INTERMISSION.</strong> Oct 9. i’m reading what i wrote above (about three weks ago) and i’m about to make a counter point. so, i’m making an argument that “it’s bad/not enough to be inside your bubble.” i find this argument hilarious. that’s how like everybody lived for most of human histories: in their villages, in their small communities. their lives revolved around maybe 20-30 other people. that was their bubble and they perfectly managed. so– thanks to the internet, did we finally accepted “people = commodity”? this is sad, very sad. this line of thinking – “there’s ALWAYS someone new” – is dangerous, as it means you don’t value your existing connections enough. so… this is not a critique of what’s above; just an observation.</p>

<p>it’s just probably important to recognize that there’s a limit of people you can keep in your life. reasonably. at SOME proximity. and that you can’t realistically find space for more people.</p>

<p>note: the above paragraph prompted me to think about a person who “scrolled through” the entire tinder. like on the planet. everyone. everywhere. there’s nobody on your planet. wow. holy shit. that would be so cool.</p>

<p>end intermission.</p>

<hr />

<p>for now, i’ll leave this piece unfinished. there’s enough here already to have a discussion/debate around it!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[something???]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://eugenekudashev.com/img/blog/how%20to%20find%20internet%20friends.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://eugenekudashev.com/img/blog/how%20to%20find%20internet%20friends.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">a call for online democracy</title><link href="/blog/online-democracy" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a call for online democracy" /><published>2022-09-21T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/online-democracy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/online-democracy"><![CDATA[<style>

<p><strong>the urgent need for digital elections: today’s tech corporations are nothing but monarchies. now is the time to build online democracies.</strong></p>

<p>tech companies create places online for people to interact. they can be thought of as public squares — public places where people can come and talk, socialize, spend time together. but these public squares are, effectively, massive countries, and the company owning the country acts as the government. the “content policy” is effectively local laws, which can be different from country to country: the Tumblr country didn’t mind nudes (until recently), but at the Instagram country the nipple is a strict no-go. if something bad happens to you in one of these countries — say, a death threat in your DMs — you go to this country’s police department, that is, you hit “Report” button. in fact, you can freely choose whether to go to Instagram police department or to New York police department — that is, your offline state’s police. the choice is far from obvious. to many, these online countries are still a mystery.</p>

<p>the relationships between citizens and the state in offline countries are never simple, and they largely vary from place to place. but generally (ideally?), the idea is that the state maintains the essential infrastructure, and in exchange the citizens are paying a percent of their income. in a democracy, the citizens have a clear, transparent mechanism for expressing their views on how the government does its job: elections. various people (“politicians”) promise some changes to the existing policies and laws, and every citizen can cast their vote. i’m intentionally oversimplifying to avoid writing a 200-page thesis on what is a democracy.</p>

<p>surely, democracy is not perfect, but all the alternatives are much worse.</p>

<p>now, how are all major tech companies operating? what’s the relationship between their citizens (“users”) and their governments? to begin with, the relationship is entirely one-sided. the local laws (“terms of service”, “content policy”, etc.) are written by the platform owner, and citizens’ opinions are almost never taken into account. as a Twitter citizen who’s unhappy about some of Twitter’s rules and decisions, your situation is tragically binary: either you stay and accept your complete helplessness, or you delete your account.</p>

<p>citizens of these online states don’t pay taxes in the traditional understanding: technically, it’s all free, the tax is 0%. but — all citizens signed a contract, agreeing to two radically important things: (1) to watch ads — as many ads as the state decides to show them, (2) to have their every move tracked, recorded, and analyzed — for making profits. again, there is no option to opt out. you either stay and give up your freedom (but you get to stay where all your friends are), or you quit — and become a digital hermit.</p>

<p>it’s quite ironic that all Western tech giants were created in democratic states, yet of all possible options they chose monarchy: the CEO is the king, and what they say goes. of course, these digital states still have to comply with laws and regulations of the actual states they technically operate it, but they carry just about zero responsibility to the digital citizens who inhabit their digital lands. and while the unhappy citizens of offline states always had the option of going on the streets and protesting, here, in these digital lands, there’s nowhere to go. the best you can do is to #DeleteUber and then tweet about it. but it would hardly matter. a week later everyone will forget, and you’ll obediently reinstall the app.</p>

<p>of course, this “situation” was unavoidable, because none of the digital states were intended as such. they started as novel fun experiments, then they grew, matured, and turned into serious businesses, and as corporations they are primarily responsible to their shareholders, not to their “users”. it’s no surprise that they do everything they can to extract as much money as possible — while they still can. no matter what the spokespeople and ad spots tell you, the goal was never to “connect the world” or “make the world a better place”. the goal was always to make money. more money. more money.</p>

<p>so it would be naive at best to expect any social good from capitalism-rooted institutions. they are not going to change anything, unless there’s a threat of losing money — or an opportunity to make more money. the only way is to learn from their mistakes, and to create new, better online states — ones that embrace the core principles and ideas of democracy, and adapt them for digital lands.</p>

<p>here’s an outline of how such a New Tech Company could look and operate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>its major goal is to provide an online public space, not to create money</li>
  <li>every citizen has an equal right to the public space</li>
  <li>no surveillance, no tracking. period</li>
  <li>the citizens can contribute financially, if they choose to.</li>
  <li>the whole thing is subsidized by governments,</li>

<p><strong>i want to make software that is useful</strong>, to many people; that is valuable, that makes sense. but that’s also surprising, pleasant, funny.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that is serious and makes sense</strong> but is also silly and doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that is not elitist</strong> and which primary goal is not Shareholder Value. i want to make software for everyone; software that addresses some very basic personal human needs, that is not for a tiny exclusive group. software that speaks a universal language.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that would somehow immensely improve human lives</strong>, one way or another. — that would help people understand one another better. — that would make it easier to learn and think. — that would help everyone live a full, interesting life.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that works in your interests</strong>. that cares about its outcome, about the way it influences you as a person. that is very self-aware of the level of responsibility here, of all the potential risks. so it takes the time. it’s working for you.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that helps realize the human potential</strong> — and that also unlocks all the technology’s potential. there’s so many, and so much of it is still not used at all. there’s no novelty in software; it’s all boring and stuck and there were no new ideas for a decade.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that looks and feels like helpful reliable objects of daily lives do.</strong> like a toothbrush, like a knife, like a chair. predictable, familiar, trustworthy. something that you own and have full control over, and can do anything you want with.</p>

<p>i want to make software for hanging out, for learning stuff, for finding people to hang out with, for building communities, for discovering the world better, for growing as a person, for being creative, for self-expression, for having fun, for being silly, for being themselves</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that people would want to use.</strong></p>

<p>i want to make software that’s beautiful, but not in the Pinterest sense.</p>

<p>i want to make software that has just 1 button.</p>

<p><strong>then i want to make software that has 0 buttons.</strong></p>

<p>i want to make software together with you.</p>

<p><strong>i want to make software that would set you free</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[some kind of a manifesto for better tech future]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://eugenekudashev.com/img/blog/i want to make software that feels like magic.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://eugenekudashev.com/img/blog/i want to make software that feels like magic.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
