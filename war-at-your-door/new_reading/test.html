    <span class="sent reveal">oh oh i got poetry on me mind.</span> 
    <span class="sent">i will probably start with flavours.</span> 
    <span class="sent">it’s either that, or it’s algorithms.</span> 
    <span class="sent">algo rhythms, it’s a music style that stem for the rhytms created by pulling the letters A L G O in various pixelated dimensions, and by applying various Plane-3 categories and toponyms in a completely random order defined by our monkey’s hawk Stephen?</span> 
      <span class="sent">what the actual fuck?</span> 
    <span class="sent">you, my friend, are confused.</span> 
    <span class="sent">it is very apparent to me, and i believe that deep down apparent to yourself too, as well.</span> 
    <span class="sent">simultaneously.</span> 
    <span class="sent">the word appeared on the screen as if it meant something.</span> 
    <span class="sent">as if this was a movie, or a dream, or one inside the other, multiple times.</span> 
    <span class="sent">it was blinkingwinking at me for my amazing beard, probably, i don’t know.</span> 
    <span class="sent">you rarely see a word actively looking at you, staring at you, basically ORDERING you to inspect it, to fucking pay attention, listen.</span> 
    <span class="sent">because this is not dead letters anymore, not text, not literature, not prose, not fucking high-brow “reading”, let all this become a relic of the past, all right? this is SPEECH.</span> <span class="sent">you are LISTENING.</span> 
    <span class="sent">writing and reading are technical acts, merely, the easiest portable for SPEECH.</span> <span class="sent">that concept is central and often overlooked, mistake.</span> 
    <span class="sent">i like that stylistic move i did over there.</span> 
    <span class="sent">“something something, mistake” — a stunning invention, really, that comma mistake really hits an interesting unusual bit, like a very short pause followed by an abrupt dead end for that sentence, as like it flows flows flows, and that pooooosh and out it goes.</span>
